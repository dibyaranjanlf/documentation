# Core Contributors & Admins

## Roles

**Core Contributors** are the people closely associated with your Collective, who will show up on your Collective page as part of the team.

**Collective Admins** are Core Contributors with extra permissions, like editing the Collective settings and approving expenses. Admins get notifications of activity on your Collective.
