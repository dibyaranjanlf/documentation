# Comparison

## What makes Open Collective different?

* **Full transparency** of both where money comes from and where it goes.
* Completely **open source**.
* Designed for **ongoing collaborative communities**, not individual creators or one-off campaigns.
* Offers [**Fiscal Hosting**](https://github.com/opencollective/documentation/tree/7991781321e21c71705dddaf37775eeb78dbe972/hosts/README.md) as a service, so projects don't need to legally incorporate or figure out taxes.
