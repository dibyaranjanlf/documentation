# Add Funds Manually

You can manually add funds to a Collective directly. This is useful when you receive a donation for a Collective outside the Open Collective system \(like a bank transfer\) and want to apply it to a Collective's budget.

Log in and go to your [Fiscal Host dashboard](fiscal-host-dashboard.md). Use the search bar to find the Collective you want to add funds for and click on **Add Funds**.

Clicking on **Add Funds** should direct you to this form:
